## Abstract

Add a configuration option to allow an administrator to add pre-dial hooks to
destinations using the `Dial` application.

## Motivation

If we (Wazo developpers) want to use the `b` option of the `Dial` application the administrator
has the burden of calling our dialplan if it wants to add a pre-dial hook.

Historically, we did not use any pre-dial hook in our dialplan. That meant that an administrator
could do the following in a subroutine.

```
[my-sub-routine]
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS}b(my-pre-dial-handler))
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
exten = s,1,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

If we start using the `b` option the administrator would have to do this

```
[my-sub-routine]
; The b has to be first to avoid running the Wazo version
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=b(my-pre-dial-handler)${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS})
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
; The hook has to call the Wazo hook as well as the administrator hook
exten = s,1n,GoSub(wazo-pre-dial-hook-copied-from-the-dialplan,s,1)
same = n,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

In the following sprints we are going to need pre-dial hooks for at least 2 stories.

1. call recording which requires the MixMonitor to be started on the other leg of the call
2. adding custom SIP headers to a call on a given trunk

Both of these stories need to use the `b` option. Both of these would break current subroutines
using the `b` option or would be broken by administrator not following the guidelines to make it possible.


## Proposition

The "Good"

I would like to add a pre-dial hook to the `Dial` for outgoing calls that would always be called
and would also allow an administrator to add a `pre-dial-hook` on an outgoing call instead of using a
subroutine to add the `b` option.

Given the following dialplan

```
[my-pre-dial-handler]
exten = s,1,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

The administrator would set `my-pre-dial-handler` on it's outgoing call `pre-dial-hook`.

When doing an outgoing call the `b` option would be set to `b(wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook)`

This dialplan would look something like this

```
[wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook]
exten = s,1,NoOp()
same = n,AGI(agi://${XIVO_AGID_IP}/outgoing_call_pre_dial_handler)
same = n,GoSub(xivo-subroutine,s,1(${WAZO_OUTCALLPREPROCESS_PRE_DIAL_HOOK}))
same = n,MixMonitor() ; if needed
same = n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,X-FOO)=BAR) ; if needed
same = n,Return()
```

The "Bad"

We can start using the `b` option with an upgrade note to tell administrators to
modify there dialplan to call our dialplan before returning

This would look like this

```
[my-sub-routine]
; The b has to be first to avoid running the Wazo version
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=b(my-pre-dial-handler)${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS})
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
; The hook has to call the Wazo hook as well as the administrator hook
exten = s,1n,GoSub(wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook,s,1)
same = n,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

And the wazo pre-dial hook would look like this

```
[wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook]
exten = s,1,NoOp()
same = n,AGI(agi://${XIVO_AGID_IP}/outgoing_call_pre_dial_handler)
same = n,MixMonitor() ; if needed
same = n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,X-FOO)=BAR) ; if needed
same = n,Return()
```

The "Ugly"

This one is a dialplan only version that allows multiple `pre-dial` handlers
to be added before the `Dial` using dialplan only

```
; First pre-dial hook added by Wazo
[add-sip-header-outgoing]
exten = s,1,Verbose(1,Adding header)
same = n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,X-MyHeader)=foobar)
same = n,Return()

; Second pre-dial hook added by Wazo
[record-outcall]
exten = s,1,NoOp(Starting the record on the client side)
same = n,MixMonitor(/tmp/outcall.wav)
same = n,Return()

[outcall]
...
; Wazo pre-dial hooks are added to the WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS using this weird syntax
same = n,Set(PUSH(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)=record-outcall^s^1)
same = n,Set(PUSH(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)=add-sip-header-outgoing^s^1)
...
; Sub routines are executed here
...
; If there are pre-dial-hooks add the `b` option to execute them all
same = n,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS}b(execute-multi-pre-dial-handlers^s^1(${WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS})))
; Dial

; This "function" will execute all "queued" hooks
[execute-multi-pre-dial-handlers]
; Most of this is crazy string splitting logic that could most likely be done with an AGI
exten = s,1,NoOp()
same = n,Set(i=1)
same = n,While($["${i}" <= "${ARGC}"])
same = n,Set(PUSH(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,^)=${ARG${i}})
same = n,Set(i=$[${i} + 1])
same = n,EndWhile()
same = n,While($["${SET(pre-dial-handler=${POP(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)})}" != ""])
same = n,NoOp(Executing ${pre-dial-handler})
same = n,GoSub(${REPLACE(pre-dial-handler,^,,)})
same = n,EndWhile()
same = n,Return()

; And finally the administrator code to add a pre-dial handler
[my-sub-routine]
This is the "magic" line that would need to be documented to replace the old XIVO_CALLOPTIONS shenanigan
exten = s,1,Set(PUSH(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)=my-pre-dial-handler^s^1)
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
same = n,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

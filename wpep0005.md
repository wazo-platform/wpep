## Abstract

Add a configuration option to allow an administrator to add pre-dial hooks to
destinations using the `Dial` application.

## Motivation

If we (Wazo developpers) want to use the `b` option of the `Dial` application the administrator
has the burden of calling our dialplan if it wants to add a pre-dial hook.

Historically, we did not use any pre-dial hook in our dialplan. That meant that an administrator
could do the following in a subroutine.

```
[my-sub-routine]
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS}b(my-pre-dial-handler))
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
exten = s,1,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

If we start using the `b` option the administrator would have to do this

```
[my-sub-routine]
; The b has to be first to avoid running the Wazo version
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=b(my-pre-dial-handler)${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS})
same = n,Return()

[my-pre-dial-handler]
; The hook has to call the Wazo hook as well as the administrator hook
exten = s,1n,GoSub(wazo-pre-dial-hook-copied-from-the-dialplan,s,1)
same = n,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

In the following sprints we are going to need pre-dial hooks for at least 2 stories.

1. call recording which requires the MixMonitor to be started on the other leg of the call
2. adding custom SIP headers to a call on a given trunk

Both of these stories need to use the `b` option. Both of these would break current subroutines
using the `b` option or would be broken by administrator not following the guidelines to make it possible.


## Proposition

The following dialplan contains pre-dial handlers that should be executed during an outgoing call

```
; Defined by the Wazo dialplan
[wazo-add-sip-header]
exten = s,1,Verbose(1,Adding header)
same = n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,X-MyHeader)=foobar)
same = n,Return()

; Defined by the Wazo dialplan
[wazo-record-outgoing-call]
exten = s,1,NoOp(Starting the record on the client side)
same = n,MixMonitor(/tmp/outcall.wav)
same = n,Return()

; User defined
[set-custom-variable]
exten = s,1,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,Return()
```

### The "Good"

I would like to add a pre-dial hook to the `Dial` for outgoing calls that would always be called
and would also allow an administrator to add a `pre-dial-hook` on an outgoing call instead of using a
subroutine to add the `b` option.

The administrator would set `set-custom-variable` on it's outgoing call `pre-dial-hook`.

When doing an outgoing call the `b` option would be set to `b(wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook)`

This dialplan would look something like this

```
[wazo-outgoing-call-pre-dial-hook]
exten = s,1,NoOp()
same = n,AGI(agi://${XIVO_AGID_IP}/outgoing_call_pre_dial_handler)
same = n,GoSub(xivo-subroutine,s,1(${WAZO_OUTCALLPREPROCESS_PRE_DIAL_HOOK}))
same = n,MixMonitor() ; if needed
same = n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,X-FOO)=BAR) ; if needed
same = n,Return()
```

### The "Bad"

We can start using the `b` option with an upgrade note to tell administrators to
modify there dialplan to call our dialplan before returning

This would look like this

```
[my-sub-routine]
; The b has to be first to avoid running the Wazo version
exten = s,1,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=b(set-custom-variableS)${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS})
same = n,Return()
```

And the wazo pre-dial hook would look like this

```
; User defined
[set-custom-variable]
exten = s,1,Set(FOO=bar)
same = n,GoSub(wazo-add-sip-header,s,1)
same = n,GoSub(wazo-record-outgoing-call,s,1)
same = n,Return()S
```

### The "stacked" solution

This one is a dialplan only version that allows multiple `pre-dial` handlers
to be added before the `Dial` using dialplan only

```
; Some plumbing to make it work

; Add a pre-dial hook to the stack (or queue)
[wazo-add-pre-dial-hook]
exten = s,1,Set(HANDLER=${ARG1})
same = n,Set(PUSH(_WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)=${HANDLER}^s^1)
same = n,Return()

; Execute all stacked (or queued) hooks
[wazo-pre-dial-hooks]
exten = s,1,NoOp()
same = n,While($["${SET(pre-dial-handler=${POP(WAZO_PRE_DIAL_HANDLERS,|)})}" != ""]) ; or SHIFT, if we want FIFO execution
same = n,NoOp(Executing ${pre-dial-handler})
same = n,GoSub(${REPLACE(pre-dial-handler,^,,)})
same = n,EndWhile()
same = n,Return()

[outcall]
...
; Add Wazo hooks in the dialplan or in the outcall AGI
same = n,Gosub(wazo-add-pre-dial-hook,s,1(wazo-add-sip-header))
same = n,Gosub(wazo-add-pre-dial-hook,s,1(wazo-record-outgoing-call))
...
; Sub routines are executed here
...
; If there are pre-dial-hooks add the `b` option to execute them all
same = n,Set(XIVO_CALLOPTIONS=${XIVO_CALLOPTIONS}b(execute-multi-pre-dial-handlers^s^1)))
; Dial

; And finally the administrator code to add a pre-dial handler
[my-sub-routine]
This is the "magic" line that would need to be documented to replace the old XIVO_CALLOPTIONS shenanigan
exten = s,1,Gosub(wazo-add-pre-dial-hook,s,1(set-custom-variable))
same = n,Return()
```

### The "Better" solution

A better solution could mix the "Good" and the "Stacked" solution

The outcall or user AGI could add pre-dial-hooks to the pre-dial hook stack while allowing
the administrator to also add new handlers AND add a `pre-dial-hook` configuration option
to objects that need it.

## Extras

### Migration

The stacked solution could allow us to transform `b(something)` in XIVO_CALLOPTIONS into a
properly stacked pre-dial hook for a while (with a warning) and keep the current customizations
working for a while. (1 year?)


### Parameters

The stacked solution allow the handler to use inherited variabled from the pre-dial dialplan if needed

```
same = n,Set(_VISIBLE=yes)
same = n,Set(VISIBLE=no)
```

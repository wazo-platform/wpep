## Abstract

To be able to synchronize databases between services.

## Motivation

When modifying (create, update delete) resources (ex: tenant, user), some
services need to know it to update their database. For now, we rely on
different mechanic to know (or not) if it happens:

* Doing nothing: when a resource is deleted, then the resource is left dead in
  other service databases (ex: tenant)

* Use bus/cache: request all resources on service start, and listen for bus
  events (ex: wazo-chatd presences)

We want services to be a stateless as possible, so that we can update
load-balanced services without problems.

## Proposition

1. Doing nothing: when a resource is deleted, then the resource is left dead in
   other service databases (ex: tenant)
  * improve: can have a manual script to purge data
  * pros: easy to implement
  * cons: can leave data inconsistency (ex: listing users presence if there are
    any deleted)

2. Use bus/persistent: Create a persistent queue and use event to keep database
   synchronized
  * pros: all the logic is left to RabbitMQ
  * cons: using RabbitMQ persistent objects was not recommended by AMQP expert
    (slow, bad scaling)
  * Note: we also need a script to initialize the queue if rabbitmq is down
    and/or desync ...

3. Use bus/cache: request all resources on service start, and listen for bus
   events
  * pros: all is dynamic and any desync issue can be solved with a service
    restart
  * cons: slow service start

4. Use bus/cron: execute cron to clean data every **X** time, and listen for
   bus events
  * pros: no impact on startup
  * cons: can be desync for one day

## Side-note
Not all service consider that sending correctly a message on rabbitmq is a part
of REST API contract. ex: On wazo-calld, a message can fail to send and the
response will be 20X. Which will break other service if it rely on this event

## Conclusion
Each situation is different and can have its own particularity. It's why there
are not one-fit-all solution.

Solution #1 (without script) should be avoided to leave potential data migration
headache in future

Solution #2 has no real advantage on actual use cases and should be avoided

Solution #3 is ideal for service that proxy and expose value from other
services without any desync possible

Solution #4 is a nice compromise between **doing nothing** and **using
bus/cache** when we deal with deleted resource. Since deleted resource are
mostly not relevant, having a desync can be acceptable

## Abstract

Make explicit the desire to migrate towards a more pytest-oriented paradigm in
integration tests.

## Motivation

The integration test framework was implemented in Wazo before the usage of
pytest. Pytest offers a very Pythonic way to organize tests and fixtures, and we
want to use this system more and more, since it offers more flexibility,
readability, performance and reusability.

## State of the art in Wazo Platform

Integration tests are organised around `AssetLaunchingTestCase`, inheriting from
the `unittest` testing framework. This organization forces tests to be organized
around a test class, which may not be as flexible as we want.

Here is an example:

```python
# helpers/base.py
class BaseAssetLaunchingTestCase(AssetLaunchingTestCase):

    assets_root = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../..', 'assets')
    asset = 'base'
    service = 'agid'

    @classmethod
    def make_agid(cls):
        port = cls.service_port(4573, 'agid')
        return AgidClient('127.0.0.1', port)

class IntegrationTest(unittest.TestCase):
    asset_cls = BaseAssetLaunchingTestCase
    agid: AgidClient

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.agid = cls.asset_cls.make_agid()

# conftest.py
from .helpers import base as asset

def pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items):
    item.parent.own_markers[0].args[0])

@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def base():
    asset.BaseAssetLaunchingTestCase.setUpClass()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        asset.BaseAssetLaunchingTestCase.tearDownClass()

# test_handlers.py
@use_asset('base')
class TestHandlers(IntegrationTest):
    def test_monitoring(self):
        recv_vars, recv_cmds = self.agid.monitoring()
        assert recv_cmds['Status'] == 'OK'
```

## Rejected propositions

* None, this proposition emerged from a refactor proposition that looked promising.

## Proposition

* Migrate all Wazo Platform projects to Pytest (looking at you wazo-confd!)
* Use Pytest fixtures system as much as possible for organizing tests and fixtures.

The `AssetLaunchingTestCase` class [was
refactored](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-test-helpers/pull/89) to be
usable in more Pytest friendly patterns, while keeping backwards-compatible with
the former style of tests.

## Example

Here is the equivalent test to the above example:

```python
# helpers/base.py
class BaseAssetLaunchingHelper(AbstractAssetLaunchingHelper):
    assets_root = Path(__file__).parents[2] / 'assets'
    asset = 'base'
    service = 'agid'

    @cached_class_property
    def agid(cls) -> AgidClient:
        port = cls.service_port(4573, 'agid')
        return AgidClient('127.0.0.1', port)

# conftest.py
@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def base_asset() -> Generator[BaseAssetLaunchingHelper, None, None]:
    yield from make_asset_fixture(BaseAssetLaunchingHelper)

# test_handlers.py
def test_monitoring(base_asset: BaseAssetLaunchingHelper) -> None:
    recv_vars, recv_cmds = base_asset.agid.monitoring()
    assert recv_cmds['Status'] == 'OK'
```

## Implementations

A more Pytest-oriented style has been used in those repos to date:

* [wazo-agid](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-agid/pull/127/files)

## Going further

Taking this idea further, we wish to replace classes with functions where
possible and class methods and properties with instance methods and properties.

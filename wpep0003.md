## Abstract

Redesign the way services checks token and acls

## Motivation

Currently Wazo-auth is heavily solicitated just for checking token validity and acls.

### First issue, A service do three API calls to wazo-auth before it starts to handle a request.

The user get a call::

    GET /calls/{call_id} HTTP/1.1
    X-Auth-Token: {token}

Then wazo-calld check the token on wazo-auth and acl with::

    HEAD /token/{token}?scope=calld.calls.create

Wazo-auth compares the scope with the user acls.

Wazo-auth returns to wazo-calld::

    204 No content

Then Wazo-calld retrieves the tenant information on wazo-auth::

    GET /token/{token}

Wazo-auth returns the information::

    200 OK
    {
        "data": {
            "acls": [],
            "auth_id": "string",
            "expires_at": "string",
            "issued_at": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "tenant_uuid": "string"
            },
            "session_uuid": "string",
            "token": "string",
            "utc_expires_at": "string",
            "utc_issued_at": "string",
        }
    }

Then Wazo-calld retrieves the tenant tree on wazo-auth to check if the user is authorized to see the call::

    GET /tenants

Wazo-auth returns the information::

    200 Ok
    {
        "filtered": 0,
        "items": [
            {
                "name": "string",
                "uuid": "string"
            }
        ],
        "total": 0
    }


Wazo-calld now checks if the user `tenant_uuid` is part of the return list to grant access to the call.

Wazo-calld can now returns the call information to the user::

    200 OK
    {
        ...
    }


### Second issue, token creation and acl with variables

When we create a token, wazo-auth retrieves the policy for the user.

If the policy contains a variable (eg: {voicemail_id}), wazo-auth will do
additional and authenticated requests to wazo-confd (that will do the post check seen previously)

Due to the previous issue, this means token creation takes 4 wazo-auth API calls
